## [D0.116.0.0] - Created 29-JUN-23
### Milestone Point
Created with Multipin support on I2S (dual neopixel) and PWM. Introduction of TestGroups.

### Added
- PWM support with segments
- tested 5, 3, 2, 1 channel (rgbcct, rgb, ww_wc, white)
- RGB (3 pins) as one segment and CW/WW as second segment
- Two CW/WW channels (two 2 pins)
- Colour (hue/sat) for RGB, and CCT Temp for white warm to cold.
- Five white only outputs, as "pixels" 1-5 in a single segment. Visually the same as 5 ws2812b pixels but really 5 unique pins
- Includes per segment brightness control, and a "master" brightness
- per segment auto timeoff (eg. turn segment on for X seconds then turn off, that time also can be set up - to 1 minute of turning off)
- All on the h801

## [Unreleased] - Development

## [B0.86.0.0]
### Added
- 

### Breaking Changed
- 

### Changed
- 

### Fixed
- Error with `encoded_custom` palette parsing

### Removed
- none

## [Unreleased] - Development

## [B0.84.84.114]
### Added
- first addition of WLED effects
- five variable rgbcct colour palettes, with scenes now selecting from them when static
- New "sunrise" effects added, although not completed
- Added operator functions to neopixellib for adding/subtracting colours to `RgbColor` and `RgbcctColor`

### Breaking Changed
- `WebServer` will remain disabled for most devices until it gets another optimised refactor
- `Scenes` as a stand alone mode will be removed, or remain as a mode that will configure `Effects` into the right format
- `Scene` Commands will no longer work, and will require using effect `Solid Palette` and `Solid RGBCCT` for the h801 hardware

### Changed
- move rgb variable user names to be part of device list 
- `internal_scene_colour` is now an pointer, which points to a user variable RgbcctColor. This can be switched, with a new variable tracking which is active (needs to change with palette.id setting)
- `Scene` and `Flasher` to become a new ``AnimationMode`` (ex. `Palettes`, `Effects`, `Animations`)
- `Effects` is the new animation of any effects

### Fixed
- 

### Removed
- none


## [Unreleased] - Development

## [B0.83.80.109]
### Added
- Custom light version for first beta tester
- Ifdef to disable additional webpages (beyond root) and the related buttons for stability testing of root page
- compression of OTA using python script
- Ability to disable webserver, mqtt, ntp while still enabling system to run via defaults in progmem (eg outside tree lighting)

### Breaking Changed
- esp32 neopixel not working with wifi
- Disabled webserver 

### Changed
- refactored ``ini`` files to allow esp8266 and esp32 compiles
- ``INFO_PARSING`` is now reffered to as ``COMMANDS`` as values are set with `CommandSet_x` functions to consolate `AddLog`
- `AnimationProfile` function/enum list changed to `SetLightPowerState`
- Refactored commands in lightinterface and animator (to be renamed `mRGBAddressable`)
- Created more files (cpp) under lighting to split code segments out for easier reading
- Cleaned `LanguageDefaults`

### Fixed
- RTC code to use interrupts, eliminating time drift

### Removed
- none
